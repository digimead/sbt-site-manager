================

*SBT Site Manager* is SBT plugin that adds routines for publishing composite documentation. That documentation is combined from different blocks like markdown files which is transformed with [Scalate][sc] templates, API pages, various static content. This integration of pre-generated, static and dynamic contents brings awesome opportunity for customisation of [L&F][lf] with fast and simple documentation process.

The plugin is based on [Booklet][bl] library.
