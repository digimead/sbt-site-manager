SBT Site Manager
================

*SBT Site Manager* is SBT plugin that adds routines for publishing composite documentation. That documentation is combined from different blocks like markdown files which is transformed with [Scalate][sc] templates, API pages, various static content. This integration of pre-generated, static and dynamic contents brings awesome opportunity for customisation of [L&F][lf] with fast and simple documentation process.

The plugin is based on [Booklet][bl] library.

The necessity to write this plugin is lack of some critical functionality in [sbt-site][ss]

The difference between  *SBT Site Manager* and [sbt-site][ss]:

Pros:

* [Booklet][bl] support :-) with template offload and user properties
* brief and full diagnostics of composite structure

Cons:

* lack of support of [Sphinx][sx], [Jekyll][jk], [Pamflet][pf], but this may be added within minutes if needed. Is this needed?
