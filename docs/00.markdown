SBT Site Manager
================

*SBT Site Manager* is a plugin for SBT. It add routines to publish composit documentation that consists from markdown files and [Scalate][sc] templates. This bind together awesome opportunity for customisation of [L&F][lf] and fast, plain markdown syntax.

The plugin is based on [Booklet][bl] library.

The necessity to write this plugin is lack of some critical functionality in [sbt-site][ss]

The differences of *SBT Site Manager*.

Pros:

* [Booklet][bl] support :-) with template offload and user properties
* brief and full diagnostics of site blocks

Cons:

* lack of support of [Sphinx][sx], [Jekyll][jk], [Pamflet][pf], but this may be added within minutes if needed. Is this needed?
